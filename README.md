# LibreELEC-compiled-addons
A growing file list of addons that comes with LibreELEC, compiled and zipped, ready to be installed on kodi.

I installed libreELEC x86 on a laptop and plugged in an F710 Logitech Gamepad, but it wasn't recognized by kodi.

After a google search I discovered that I might be missing the peripheral.joystick addon, but I couldn't find a zip of the addon anywhere, so I compiled it from source.

Thought I'd share the zip for anyone else in need for this addon.

If anyone need another addon, let me know, might add it.

Hope this help someone,
Cheers.
